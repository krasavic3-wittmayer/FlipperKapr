Flipper Kapr 🐟

Flipper Kapr is a DIY Arduino-based experimental device, inspired by the idea of tools like Flipper Zero.
Its purpose is learning, experimentation, and exploration of embedded systems and communication protocols, not hacking or illegal activity.

This project is mainly educational and was built to understand how different modules and signals work together on microcontrollers.

What is this?

Flipper Kapr is a personal Arduino project that combines multiple modules into a single device for:

experimenting with signals and protocols

learning how hardware modules communicate

understanding embedded programming in practice

It is not a “one-click hack tool” and does not magically break secure systems.

Features

Depending on the build/version, Flipper Kapr may include:

Infrared (IR) signal sending/receiving

Sub-GHz RF communication (e.g. 433 MHz modules)

NFC / RFID experiments

Simple UI (buttons, LEDs, display – if connected)

Features depend on the hardware you attach.

Hardware

Typical components used:

Arduino-compatible board

IR transmitter / receiver

RF module (e.g. 433 MHz)

Optional: NFC/RFID module, display, buttons

Exact wiring and modules may vary.

Software

Written in Arduino (C/C++)

Uses standard Arduino libraries and module-specific libraries

Code is kept simple and readable for learning purposes

How to use

Connect the hardware modules according to your setup

Open the project in the Arduino IDE

Select the correct board and port

Upload the code
