# Flipper Kapr 🐟🐟🐟🐟

Flipper Kapr is a **DIY Arduino-based experimental device**, inspired by tools like Flipper Zero.  
Its purpose is **learning, experimentation, and exploration of embedded systems and communication protocols**, not hacking or illegal activity.

This project is mainly educational and was built to understand how different modules and signals work together on microcontrollers.

## What is this?

Flipper Kapr 🐟 is a personal Arduino project that combines multiple modules into a single device for:

- experimenting with signals and protocols  
- learning how hardware modules communicate  
- understanding embedded programming in practice  

It is **not** a “one-click hack tool” and does **not** magically break secure systems.

## Features

Depending on the build/version, Flipper Kapr may include:

- Infrared (IR) signal sending and receiving  
- NFC / RFID experiments  
- Simple UI (buttons, LEDs, display – if connected)  

Features depend on the hardware you attach.

## Hardware

Typical components used:

### Arduino Mega 2560

- IR transmitter / receiver  
- RFID module (e.g. 13.56 MHz / 125 kHz)  
- **Bad USB** (emulates a keyboard and sends keystrokes when connected to a computer)  

Exact wiring and modules may vary.

## Software

### Arduino (C/C++)

- Uses standard Arduino libraries and module-specific libraries  
- Code is kept simple and readable for learning purposes  

## How to use

1. Connect the hardware modules according to your setup  
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE  
3. Select the correct board and port  
4. Upload the code  
5. Experiment responsibly
